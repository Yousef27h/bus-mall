# bus-mall

Hello and welcome to my new project. My name is Yousef Salem, I'm Currently enrolled in an intensive course in Software Development which is provided by Abdul Aziz Ghurair School of Advanced Computing (ASAC) in collaboration with Code Fellows Academy in Seattle – US.

This repository contains my BusMall project work during code201 course, To make market analysis maximally effective, BusMall wanted to build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups.


The app’s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.


In this repository I mainly used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete my project.
